# DriversService

A list of all methods in the `DriversService` service. Click on the method name to view detailed information about that method.

| Methods                                     | Description                      |
| :------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------- |
| [list_of_all_drivers](#list_of_all_drivers) | To obtain a list of all drivers. |

Driver lists can be refined by adding one or more of the following criteria:

/circuits/<circuitId>
/constructors/<constructorId>
/drivers/<driverId>
/grid/<position>
/results/<position>
/fastest/<rank>
/status/<statusId>

For example, to list all drivers who have driven for a specific constructor at a particular circuit:

http://ergast.com/api/f1/constructors/mclaren/circuits/monza/drivers

Alternatively, to list the drivers who have achieved a particular final position in the championship:

http://ergast.com/api/f1/driverStandings/1/drivers

Drivers who participated in the 2014 season onwards have a permanent driver number. |
|[list_of_all_drivers_within_a_year](#list_of_all_drivers_within_a_year)| This endpoint is to obtain a list of all drivers in a particular season (year) |
|[list_of_all_drivers_within_a_race_in_a_year](#list_of_all_drivers_within_a_race_in_a_year)| This endpoint is to obtain a list of all drivers in a particular race(round) of a season(year) |
|[driver_information](#driver_information)| Each driver listed in the response is identified by a unique driverId which is used to identify the driver throughout the API. To obtain information about a particular driver append the driverId

This endpoint is to obtain the information of a particular driver based on the driverid (driver name) |
